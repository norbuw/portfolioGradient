            <p>Hello! I am Norbu, a Tibetan born in Tibet, raised as a stateless person in India, a refugee in France,
              and
              currently a French citizen living in Paris. The fusion of art and technology has always fascinated me and
              I
              have never been afraid to take the plunge, be it with Paint, Photoshop, Lightroom, Figma, or Adobe
              XD.<br><br>
              As a photographer, I like to capture the moment by appreciating the beauty and value of what I see.
              <br><br>
              Recently, I have taken up creative digital design and web development.
              I love creating beautiful web experiences focused on simplicity and purpose on the internet and in life. I
              am always open to learning and improving myself and my skills, as there is no end to learning, but there
              are
              many beginnings.<br><br>
              One of my favorite quotes is from Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet:
            </p>
            <blockquote>“If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice
              compassion.”
            </blockquote>
